# PlexEXTWolff

Does stuff to make Plex better. A slight adaption from [skoshy's](https://github.com/skoshy) [PlexEXT](https://github.com/skoshy/PlexEXT) to incorporate my network setup better.

## What stuff?

Incorporates some CSS changes
Brightness Control using hotkeys (see hotkeys below)

## What are all the hotkeys I can use?

- **Shift+PageUp** will increase the brightness of the video
- **Shift+PageDown** will decrease the brightness.

## How do I install it?

1. Get [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or another userscript manager
2. Install latest version from GitHub by [clicking here](https://github.com/jadonwolffs/PlexEXT/raw/master/userscript.user.js).

## Known Issues

None so far! If you find any, let me know and if it's deeper than my adaptions I'll pass along to skoshy
